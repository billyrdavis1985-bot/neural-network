# Neural Network From Scratch (NumPy Only)

A fully implemented deep neural network built from scratch using only NumPy.

- Architecture: 2 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 1 (ReLU + Sigmoid)
- Trained on the classic "moons" dataset
- Achieves **99.5% accuracy**
- Includes full forward/backward propagation, training loop, and decision boundary visualization
